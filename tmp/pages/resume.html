			<p>In 14 years as a software developer, seven years in technical support and documentation, I have developed significant skills in managing projects, challenges and customer service. My education as an engineer and as a technical writer complements those skills with an ability to see documentation and technology from the end-user perspective. I keep myself updated on best practices and changing technology to ensure that I can provide the best product possible.</p>
			<p>I will put all of my skills, abilities and experiences to efficient and effective use as a software developer.</p>
